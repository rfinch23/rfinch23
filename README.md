- 👋 Hi, I’m @rfinch23
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino Uno REV3 and Rpie
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Arduino Uno REV3
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Force Sensor,0-10kg Force Sensitive Resistor Resistive Flexible Thin Film
- Can the  Force Sensor,0-10kg Force Sensitive Resistor Resistive Flexible Thin Film be used with a Arduino Uno REV3 [A000066], 
- i am wanting to get a sound alert when the weight goes over 4GK, I would also need to set this up with two Force Sensor,0-10kg Force Sensitive Resistor
- Resistive. Or is there a better way of doing this?
- Flexible Thin Film to ensure equal meserments on say the left hand side and the right hand side of an object.
